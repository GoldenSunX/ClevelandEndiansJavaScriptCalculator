# Project 5
### JavaScript Calculator
No special tools are needed for the viewing of the webpage. It can be viewed properly in either Firefox or Chrome by simply opening the calculator.html file.
 
NOTE: Keypress functionality has been added to the calculator, but it was intended to work with the numpad keys, and may/may not work with all keyboards.
 This can be used by simply typing the key of the button you would want to click.
